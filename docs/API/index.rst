Quantipy: Python survey data toolkit
====================================
Quantipy is an open-source data processing, analysis and reporting software
project that builds on the excellent `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ libraries. Aimed at social and marketing research survey data, Quantipy offers support for native handling of special data types like multiple choice variables, statistical analysis using case or observation weights, dataset metadata and customizable reporting exports.
