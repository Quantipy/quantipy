===================
Latest (04/06/2018)
===================

**New**: Additional variable (names) "getter"-like and resolver methods

* ``DataSet.created()``
*  ``DataSet.find(str_tags=None, suffixed=False)``
* ``DataSet.names()``
* ``DataSet.resolve_name()``

A bunch of new methods enhancing the options of finding and testing for variable
names have been added. ``created()`` will list all variables that have been added
to a dataset using core functions, i.e. ``add_meta()`` and ``derive()``, resp.
all helper methods that use them internally (as ``band()`` or ``categorize()`` do
for instance).

The ``find()`` method is returning all variable names that contain any of the
provided substrings in ``str_tags``. To only consider names that end with these
strings, set ``suffixed=True``. If no ``str_tags`` are passed, the method will
use a default list of tags including ``['_rc', '_net', ' (categories', ' (NET', '_rec']``.

Sometimes a dataset might contain "semi-duplicated" names, variables that differ
in respect to case sensitivity but have otherwise identical names. Calling
``names()`` will report such cases in a ``pd.DataFrame`` that lists all name
variants under the respective ``str.lower()`` version. If no semi-duplicates
are found, ``names()`` will simply return ``DataSet.variables()``.

Lastly, ``resolve_name()`` can be used to return the "proper", existing representation(s) of a given variable name's spelling.

**New**: ``Batch.remove()``

Not needed batches can be removed from ``meta``, so they are not aggregated
anymore.

""""

**New**: ``Batch.rename(new_name)``

Sometimes standard batches have long/ complex names. They can now be changed
into a custom name. Please take into account, that for most hubs the name of
omnibus batches should look like 'client ~ topic'.

""""

**Update**: Handling verbatims in ``qp.Batch``

Instead of holding the well prepared open-end dataframe in ``batch.verbatims``,
the attribute is now filled by ``batch.add_open_ends()`` with instructions to
create the open-end dataframe. It is easier to to modify/ overwrite existing
verbatims. Therefore also a new parameter is included ``overwrite=True``.

""""

**Update**: ``Batch.copy(..., b_filter=None, as_addition=False)``

It is now possible to define an additional filter for a copied batch and also
to set it as addition to the master batch.

""""

**Update**: Regrouping the variable list using ``DataSet.order(..., regroup=True)``

A new parameter called ``regroup`` will instruct reordering all newly created
variables into their logical position of the dataset's main variable order, i.e.
attempting to place *derived* variables after the *originating* ones.

""""

**Bugfix**: ``add_meta()`` and duplicated categorical ``values`` codes

Providing duplicated numerical codes while attempting to create new metadata
using ``add_meta()`` will now correctly raise a ``ValueError`` to prevent
corrupting the ``DataSet``.

>>> cats = [(1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C'), (3, 'D'), (2, 'AA')]
>>> dataset.add_meta('test_var', 'single', 'test label', cats)
ValueError: Cannot resolve category definition due to code duplicates: [2, 3]
